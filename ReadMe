This directory includes the source code for the following paper:
Samani et. al. Artificial intelligence-based locoregional markers of brain peri-tumoral microenvironment  

The repository contains the following source codes:
•	CNN-train.py: extracts patches and train the C-NN.
•	CNN-Test.py: gets the result of  the CNN on all test samples and writes the result in the results folder.
•	MaskMaker.py: reads the output of the CNN and produce PMI maps.
•	LocoregionalMarkers.py: extracts locoregional markers from the PMI map.

The repository contains the following folders:
•	TrainSamples and TestSamples: each train/test sample should have the mask of tumor and edema, and free water volume fraction from DTI 
o	train samples should have a list.txt file that contain diagnosis of either 'Met' or 'GBM'
•	Models: the trained models will be saved here
•	Results: the CNN-results, PMI maps and locoregional features will be saved here
